# Data-Wrangling-with-WeRateDogs-twitter
Data Wrangling with WeRateDogs twitter. Csv, txt files with json objects and image predictions. Woof!

> This project was based on wrangling WeRateDogs twitter account. I used archived data from each tweet, image predctions of the dogs from a Udacity algorithim and users favorite and retweet counts to answer some questions about the data. 

- **Wrangle_report** is a good place to start to understand what files I worked with. 

- **Act_report** is a summary of the questions answered. 

- **Wrangle_act** is the whole project from start to finish, go have a look. 

> It should be noted that I included all files in html and ipynb, you can choose whichever is easiest for you to view.
